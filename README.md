# JobScanner-Twitter

Simple web app made with python and django using Tweepy to be able to use python wth the Twitter API. Search keywords and it returns a list of tweets related to that keyword.

This is a project I set for myself to learn data scrapping using python.

The env folder is used for making the app in virtualenv used with python.

Used: Tweepy for Twitter API / django-propeller
